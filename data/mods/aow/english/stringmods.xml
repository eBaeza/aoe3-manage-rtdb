		<string _locid="603027">Those natives won't stick with you for long if you don't give them anything in return. It's best you leave them to our care.</string>
		<string _locid="603028">That Trading Post won't be helping you much. We'll rob the train long before it delivers you any goods.</string>
		<string _locid="603029">Destroy my property all you want. I've got a stick a dynamite with your name on it too.</string>

		<string _locid="603037">You can burn our buildings, but we can still find refuge in the trees!</string>										
		<string _locid="603038">What false promises have you made to those natives so that they would help you?</string>
		<string _locid="603039">Don't get too comfortable in that trade site. It won't belong to you for much longer.</string>
		<string _locid="603040">How dare you?! Prepare to feel the consequences of your actions!</string>
		<string _locid="603041">One more Town Center, one less Town Center, with all the wood in our rainforest we can build as many as you destroy!</string>												
		<string _locid="603042">Don't drag those natives to their demise alongside you.</string>
		<string _locid="603043">How exactly do you think that Trading Post is going to help you against the Rapa Nui?</string>
		<string _locid="603044">This assault will not be forgotten. You have been marked.</string>
		<string _locid="603045">Ha! That Town Center was nothing but a distraction!</string>														
		<string _locid="603046">Those natives will abandon you quickly once they realize they can prosper much more within my sphere of influence.</string>
		<string _locid="603047">I must admit I am a bit envious of that Trading Post. Guess I'll just have to blow it up and place one of my own in that trade site.</string>
		<string _locid="603048">You think I'll just overlook this?! You better prepare yourself for my counter strike!</string>
		<string _locid="603049">No! My Town Center! Look at what you've done!</string>																
		<string _locid="603050">Seeking the help of the Natives so soon? If you are so weak in numbers you will find it hard to face the army of the Oyo Empire.</string>
		<string _locid="603051">That Trading Post is a strategical advantage you won't have for long.</string>
		<string _locid="603052">You are a fool if you think this puts you in any advantage! This is but a minor setback for the Yoruba!</string>
		<string _locid="603053">The destruction of my Town Center means nothing! The Oyo Empire is wherever the Yoruba are!</string>																		
		<string _locid="603054">Those Natives must be confused. They would never ally themselves with you if they knew what I could offer them.</string>
		<string _locid="603055">That Trading Post is bothering me. I will probably dispose of it soon.</string>
		<string _locid="603056">Hmph! It's only a matter of time until I get that site back!</string>
		<string _locid="603057">Do you think this assures you victory? You should know by now from past history that the Mayans are not so easy to conquer!</string>																				
		<string _locid="603058">Was the alliance to those Natives a strategical move, or an act of desperation?</string>
		<string _locid="603059">The sands of desert will swallow that Trading Post soon enough. And if they don't, I will.</string>
		<string _locid="603060">A small nuisance, but nothing I haven't accounted for.</string>
		<string _locid="603061">Your strategy is proving effective, but I may surprise you yet.</string>																						
		<string _locid="603062">An ally? How pathetic are you that you need those natives to carry you to victory?</string>
		<string _locid="603063">Was that Trading Post really your priority? Good luck on your trading once we have razed your whole town.</string>
		<string _locid="603064">You dare challenge us?! You will feel the extent of the Zulu might!</string>
		<string _locid="603065">Provoke us at your own risk. You will come to regret destroying our Town Center!</string>																								
		<string _locid="603066">Those Natives would benefit much more from a Visita being built in their village. Why don't you remove your Trading Post before I'm forced to do it for you.</string>
		<string _locid="603067">A Trading Post? Already? What aspects of your growth are you neglecting?</string>
		<string _locid="603068">An offense against the Jesuits is an offense against God! Are you prepare to face His divine judgement?!</string>
		<string _locid="603069">What makes you think that destroying our Town Center ensures you any advantage? Our builders must be building another one as we speak!</string>																										
		<string _locid="603070">So you seek the help of the Natives? Let's see how they fare against my mercenaries.</string>
		<string _locid="603071">That Trading Post is just another obstacle for me to get rid of.</string>
		<string _locid="603072">That was a mistake you will not be afforded to repeat!</string>
		<string _locid="603073">Your brutality will be met in kind once it is I that is raiding your village!</string>		
		<string _locid="603074">Let us hope you are capable of maintaining that alliance. I fear you don't stand much of a chance without it.</string>
		<string _locid="603075">Keep your eyes on your Trading Post. Blink too slowly and when you open your eyes again it might not be there anymore.</string>
		<string _locid="603076">Steel yourself, each blow you deliver will be returned to you in threefold!</string>
		<string _locid="603077">Destroy as you wish, the Khmers are experienced in rising from the ashes!</string>				
		<string _locid="603078">Those Natives will not help you if you don't know how to guide them.</string>
		<string _locid="603079">Let's hope the resources you spent on that Trading Post this early pay off later on.</string>
		<string _locid="603080">If destruction is all your capable of doing, than destruction is also what you shall receive!</string>
		<string _locid="603081">You may burn our wood, but you will not dim our spirits!</string>						
		<string _locid="603082">My heart hurts for the people that needs to endure your tyranny.</string>
		<string _locid="603083">Is that Trading Post your only hope for a prospering economy?</string>
		<string _locid="603084">This destruction does not come as a surprise. We are prepared to strike back in kind!</string>

		<string _locid="604746">How careless of you to advance in age so quickly. No matter, I will be catching up to you in no time!</string>
		<string _locid="604747">I doubt a layman like you could make good use of this Trading Post. Just leave it to someone who knows better, like me, of course.</string>
		<string _locid="604748">I hope those worthless trinkets can at least bring you good fortune during this encounter.</string>
		<string _locid="604749">A most desirable find.</string>
		<string _locid="604750">Should you really be allowing me to claim all the treasures by myself? I don't think you should be giving me all these oportunities to get ahead when your chances of winning are already so slim...</string>
		<string _locid="604751">If I was in your position, I would try to rely on the natives too. Good luck...</string>
		<string _locid="604752">Good, you claimed the first Trading Post... now what? Do you even know what to do with it?</string>
